<b>Date:</b> 04/03/2024 <br>
<strong>Description:</strong>
Design an API with 3 endpoints: <br> <br>

<b>Endpoints:</b> <br>
<b>1.</b> Endpoint that accepts 2 numbers.  Once you have the numbers, add them together and print out the results in a sentence. <br>
     - Example results, "The sum of 2 and 2 is 4." <br> <br>

<b>2.</b> Endpoint that accepts 2 inputs. You will take the answer from those inputs and display the answer in one sentence. <br>
     - What is your name?  <br>
     - What time did you wake up? <br>
     *Your output should be a sentence that tells me who the person is and what time they woke up <br> <br>

<b>3.</b> Endpoint that accepts 2 numbers. Results should print the following 2 statements: <br>
     I. The first statement should tell me if the first number is greater than, less than or equal to the second number. <br>
     II. The second statement should tell me if the second number is greater than, less than, or equal to the first number. <br> <br>

NOTE!!!  my bin and obj folders were created after first use on my PC.  If you wish to see your first use, ERASE bin and obj  if necessary!!! <br><br>

Things to turn in: <br>
- Project, zipped <br>
- Github link in comments <br>
- Don't forget the peer review! <br> <br>

Comments: The big 3 endpoints work as required.Endpoint 1 accepts 2 numbers and outputs the sum. Endpoint 2  accvcepts in put to display name and time woke up. Endpoint 3 accepts 2 users input to give an output of which number is less than greater than or equal to. Good Work.  <br>
